# Project Description #

This application is for anyone interested in looking for a sports team or group to play with in their area, be it recreational or amateur. Users can make postings day of or for a future date, seeking other users to join their activity / sport. Other users can then look for pre-existing groups and join them.
The application will store user data (Eg., a profile: name, profile picture, email address, interests / sports they play), group data (group name, users in the group, group interests / type / genre), posting data (event name, event date, event duration, event type, event location, event size, participants, comments on the post). Users would be able to make a profile, see other peopleâ€™s profiles (and contact through email), join / create groups, and make postings or interact with existing postings. Users will be able to search for other users or groups with similar interests.
Additional functionality may include shareability of event postings with other users / groups, creating leagues, and publicity of groups.
